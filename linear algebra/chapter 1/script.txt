Imagine a Line, this has no direction. 

we can define a direction by giving an arrow. now thi is a line that has a direction. 
in this case it is towards the north. 

now let's restrict this line to two points, a and b. now this is your line segment, with a direction. 

Ladies and gentlemen this is nothing but a vector. 
So a vector is a quantity that has both, magnitude and a direction. which is usually represented with an arrow

where magnitude tells you the length of the vector, denoted by |v| or simple v 

and remember |v|>=0 can never be negative 

let's consider 2D space 

This is how you write a vector in 2D Space 
in 3 D it will be like this.
