Subspace
--------
A subspace of a vector space is a set of vectors (including 0 vector) that satisfies two requirements: if v and w are vectors in the subspace and c is any scalar, then 
i) v+W is in the subspace 
ii) cv is in the subspace 

basis vectors are linearly independent vectors that span the space 

every vector in the space is a unique unique combination of basis vectors 

dimension refers to the number of basis vectors that space a particular space
OR 
dimension of a space is the number of vectors in every basis



Absolutely — here's a concise and clean summary of those 5 fundamental linear algebra concepts:

---

1. Vector Space (or Space)  
A vector space is a collection of vectors where you can perform vector addition and scalar multiplication, and still stay within the space.  
Examples: \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), \( \mathbb{R}^3 \), or the set of all polynomials of degree ≤ n.

---

2. Subspace  
A subspace is a smaller "space" inside a vector space that also satisfies the rules of a vector space.  
It must:
- Contain the zero vector
- Be closed under addition
- Be closed under scalar multiplication

Example: The span of some vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) forms a subspace like a line or plane through the origin.

---

3. Span  
The span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors.  
It forms the smallest subspace containing those vectors.

Example: The span of a single vector in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) is a line through the origin.

---

4. Basis Vectors  
A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span a space.  
They serve as the "coordinate system" or building blocks for that space.

Example: In 

form the standard basis.

---

5. Dimension  
The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis of that space.  
It tells you how many degrees of freedom or directions exist.

Example:  
- A line has dimension 1  
- A plane has dimension 2  
- \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) has dimension 3
