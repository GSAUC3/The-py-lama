### 🎬 **Revised Script Draft**

---

**[Opening Greeting]**

🎙️  
"Greetings, ladies and gentlemen!  
Welcome to another episode in our **Linear Algebra Series**.

Today, we’ll unravel two fundamental concepts:

1. **Span**  
2. **Linear Independence**

Let’s dive right in."

---

**[Span Section]**

🧠  
"The **span** of a set of vectors is the set of **all possible linear combinations** you can form using those vectors.

To visualize this:

- If you have **just one vector**, its span is a **line** — all the scaled versions of that vector pointing in both directions through the origin.
  
- Now, if you’re in **2D space** and you take **two linearly independent vectors**, their span covers the **entire plane**.  

- If those same two vectors live in **3D space**, then their span forms a **plane through the origin** — a flat sheet stretching infinitely in 3D."

**[Linear Independence (brief intro)]**

💡  
"That brings us to the idea of **linear independence**.

Vectors are linearly independent if **none of them can be written as a combination of the others**.  
This property is crucial — because **only independent vectors add new directions** to the span.

We’ll explore that more in just a moment."

**[Transition / Outro]**

📌  
"Stick around as we animate these concepts and build some geometric intuition behind them.  
Let’s bring these vectors to life!"

Would you like help writing the voiceover script for the **linear independence** section too? Or want this turned into a full storyboard with Manim animations lined up?
