"Hey lamas, welcome to the first video of this linear algebra series.

 This is just an introductory video where we are going to begin by answering the first question: What are vectors?

Assuming that you all are familiar with scalars, which are numbers used for quantifying things.

 For example, 5 apples, 10 oranges, 2.5 men.
 
  All these numbers are scalars; they basically give you information about the magnitude of these things.

Now, vectors, on the other hand, provide additional information along with magnitude, and whats that additional information?

a direction!!



geometrically it is represented as an arrow, where the tail begins from the origin (0,0) to any arbitrary point in space.
for the time being, we will stick to 2 D space.
 
[draw a vector, and label it as vector v]


this is how you represent a vector, v with an arrow above it.
v = |v| n_hat

|v| is the magnitude and n_hat is the direction

for some n_hat might be this way, or perhaps that way. basically it's not a standard notation, there has to be some standard direction for everybody to understand. 

solution is unit vectors along the axes 

think of this vector v.

this can be written as:

v = i + j
where,
these two (i and j) tells you the direction along x and y axis respectively 

these two, ladies and gentlemen are called unit vectors.

means vectors with magnitude equals 1. 

--
 use the matrix representation:
 answer the following questions: 
 
 - how do you represent this in matrix format
 - in 2d 
 - in 3d 
 
 
 Q) how to add two vectors ? 
 
 Q) vector Scaling? or multiplying a matrix with a scalar
